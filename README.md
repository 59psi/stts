stts is a macOS app for monitoring the status of cloud services.

With a click of the menubar icon, you can see the status of your favorite services. You can also be notified when a service goes down or gets restored.

stts is designed to be unobtrusive, only giving you the information you need and allowing you to access the status page with a single click.

stts can be downloaded from the Mac App Store [here](https://itunes.apple.com/app/stts/id1187772509?ls=1&mt=12).

### Contributing

Adding services is quite straightforward, and can be as easy as adding a few lines (especially if they're based on statuspage.io). For examples, check `stts/Services/` and `stts/Services/StatusPage`.
